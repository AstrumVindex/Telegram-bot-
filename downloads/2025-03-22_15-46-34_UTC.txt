Thunder by Imagine Dragons? Straight-up a glow-up anthem. Dan Reynolds went from "that weird kid" to "main character energy", and the song blew upâ€”like #4 on Billboard, Diamond-certified kinda blown up. The robotic vocals? Lowkey futuristic. The music video? Straight outta an alien sci-fi fever dream, shot in Dubai. TikTok ate it up, and itâ€™s been living rent-free in NFL, NBA, and ads ever since. Oh, and it bagged Best Rock Song at the Billboard Music Awards, no biggie. Certified banger, no skips.
